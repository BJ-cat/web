                Traditional Uyghur music and dance, featuring vibrant costumes and energetic movements, are an integral part of Hami's cultural landscape and are often showcased at 
                festivals and celebrations. One of the most important festivals celebrated in Hami is Eid al-Fitr, also known as "Roza Ait" or "Corban Festival" in Uyghur culture. 
                This holiday marks the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan. Eid is a time of joy, gratitude and togetherness, where family and friends come together to share 
                festive meals, exchange gifts and participate in charitable activities to help those in need. Preparations for Eid usually start days in advance, with households cleaning 
                and decorating their homes and individuals buying new clothes for the occasion. As captured by the blogger in the video, the Uighurs are celebrating their festival.
