      Xinjiang Lamb Skewers: This iconic street food consists of tender pieces of lamb skewered and grilled over an open flame. The lamb is typically seasoned with 
      a blend of spices including cumin, chili powder, and salt, giving it a savory and slightly spicy flavor. The grilling process adds a smoky aroma to the meat, 
      enhancing its taste. Roast Whole Lamb: A centerpiece of festive occasions and celebrations in Xinjiang, roast whole lamb is a grand and flavorful dish. The lamb is marinated with 
      a mixture of spices and herbs such as cumin, garlic, and Sichuan peppercorns, then roasted on a spit over an open fire for several hours until the meat is tender 
      and succulent. The result is a mouthwatering dish with crispy skin and juicy, flavorful meat. Xinjiang Grilled Dumplings: This food is a popular street food in Xinjiang, appreciated for their crispy exterior and juicy filling. The dumplings are filled 
      with seasoned ground meat, typically lamb or beef, along with onions and spices. They are then grilled or baked in a tandoor oven until golden brown and crispy. 
      The heat from the oven creates a delightful contrast between the crunchy outer shell and the tender, flavorful filling inside.
      Xinjiang Polo: Also known as "pilaf" or "polo," this dish is a staple of Xinjiang cuisine and a hearty meal in itself. It consists of seasoned rice 
      cooked with chunks of tender meat, typically lamb or chicken, along with carrots, onions, and sometimes raisins or dried fruits. The rice is infused with a 
      rich blend of spices such as cumin, cinnamon, and cloves, giving it a fragrant aroma and robust flavor. The dish is traditionally cooked in a large pot and served 
      communal-style, with diners using their hands to "grab" portions of rice and meat.
